The with statement creates a block of code that is executed within a certain context.
A context is defined by a context manager that provides a pair of methods describing
how to enter and leave the context. User-defined contexts are generally used only in
advanced code and can be quite complex, but a common basic example of a built-in
context manager involves file input / output. Here, the context is entered by opening
the file. Within the context block, the file is read from or written to, and finally the file
is closed on exiting the context. The file object is a context manager that is returned
by the open() method. It defines an exit method which simply closes the file (if it was
opened successfully), so that this does not need to be done explicitly. To open a file
